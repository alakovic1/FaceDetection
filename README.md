# FaceDetection

This repository contains 4 different implementations of Face Detection using Python OpenCV library.

1. FaceDetection.py file contains the basic implementation of face detection from picture
2. ViolaJones.py file contains implementation of the Viola Jones algorithm from picture (similar to the first implementation)
3. WebCamFaceDetection.py file contains implementation of the Viola Jones algorithm and face detection from computers video camera
4. EyeDetection.py file contains implementation of face detection and eye detection from computer video camera

All projects are using OpenCV *detectMultiScale* method that returns all the found faces in the photo. Also, all of them are using different classifiers (presented as XML files) to determine the rules of the face.
